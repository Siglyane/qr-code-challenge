### What I learned

I recently took on a challenge from the Frontend Mentor site to improve my HTML and CSS skills. Typically, I develop front-end projects using React, so my experience with pure HTML and CSS is limited. This challenge gave me a chance to dive deeper into the fundamentals. It was also the first time I encountered the :root pseudo-class and CSS variables. I learned how to define and reuse variables throughout my styles, making the code more maintainable and efficient.

```css
:root {
	--white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	--slate300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	--slate500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
	--slate900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```
